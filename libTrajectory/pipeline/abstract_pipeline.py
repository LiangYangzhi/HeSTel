Pipeline:

Data preparation: Firstly, prepare the training and testing datasets.
    This can be done by reading raw data from files, and performing preprocessing and feature engineering operations to
    obtain the input data required for the model.

Model definition: Choose an appropriate model based on the task type and data characteristics.
    During model definition, set the model's hyperparameters and optimizer(Todo).

Model training: Input the prepared data into the model and train it.
    During training, techniques such as cross-validation can be used for model selection and tuning.

Model prediction: Use the trained model to make prediction on new data.

Model evaluation: Evaluation the trained model using the testing dataset.
    Calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, mean squared error, etc, to assess the model's performance.

Model saving and loading: Save the trained model to a file for future use.

Result analysis and visualization: Analyze and visualize the prediction results to
    better understand the model's output and performance
